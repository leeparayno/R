    "contents" : "# Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project\n\n## Overview\n\nThe UCI Human Activity Recognition project performed some tests involving Samsung\nsmartphones, gathering data provided by subject individuals performing a variety \nof activities--with the smartphones providing various sensor data that was available\n\nThe data set is available here:\n\nhttp://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones\n\n## Project Description\n\nThis project provides a set of functions for processing the raw data set provided by \nUCI.\n\n## Functions\n### mergeDataset - function\n   Purpose:    \n   \n   This function will combine the data sets for the training and test data sets into one combined data frame, with clean feature column names. The data frame will also be subsetted to include the mean and standard deviation values in the original data set, and have all activities labeled descriptively\n\n   Arguments:  \n   \n- trainDir - path to the directory where the training data set for the \n                           UCI Human Activity Recognition project\n- testDir - path to the directory where the test data set is\n- featuresFile - path to the features file detailing all the features\n                               in the data file set\n- activityLabelFile - path to the file that lists all the activities \n                                   performed by the subjects in the study\n\n   Returns:    \n   \n   A data frame that has been properly formated with combined data from the train and test data sets, with cleaned feature names and properly assigned activity labels\n   \n\n\n\n### cleanFeatureLabels - function\n   Purpose:    \n   \n   This function will clean some of the stray punctuation that could cause issues with other code. It also replaces some abbreviations to make the feature names more meaningful\n   \n   Arguments:  \n   \n- featuresFile - path to the file listing all the features in the\n                               data set\n   Returns:    \n   \n   vector of feature names with no punctuation and more meaniful names\n   \n\n               \n### createAverageOfMeanSTD - function\n   Purpose: \n   \n   Process the mean of all the values after grouping by activity and subject\n\n   Arguments:  \n   \n- data (required) - must be a data.frame with all the raw data records as processed by mergeDataset\n- outputFile - optional path to write the summarized data table to a file\n\n   Returns: \n   \n   data.frame of summarized mean values\n   \n\n### Developer: Lee Parayno\n",
